Speaker B: You're up early.
Speaker A: Hey, buddy. How's it going?
Speaker B: Whoa. Yo. What?
Speaker A: What?
Speaker B: Why is your voice.
Speaker A: So deep? It's just a little deeper in the morning. Yours doesn't do that.
Speaker B: You sound like you're narrating a Ford commercial.
Speaker A: Yeah, I get that sometimes. Is that, like, a.
Speaker B: Condition?
Speaker A: I don't know why it does that. Daniel, it's early. Will you let me enjoy my morning in peace?
Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker A: I'm going to make some tea for Dennis. You want one, too?
Speaker B: No, sir. No, no, no, thank you, hoodie guy.
Speaker A: An FYI, Dennis is a little under the weather. He sounds terrible. Try not to draw attention to it. I think he's self conscious. Do you mean self conscious?
Speaker B: Oh, my God. Morning.
