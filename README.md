###### In progress...
Speech SOS is an ongoing project aimed at creating a revolutionary voice-activated emergency assistance system. This system is designed to detect distress signals and potential danger cues in real-time environments, enabling users to call for help hands-free and ensuring swift aid with integrated location tracking. The project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as speech-to-text processing, sentiment analysis, and communication protocols to deliver an efficient and reliable emergency response solution.

### Technologies Utilized:
- Stanford CoreNLP for sentence separation.
- Assembly AI for speech-to-text conversion.
- Llama 2 13B CPP model for real-time speech analysis.

-Can be improved by transfer learning (obviously ðŸ˜‰)
